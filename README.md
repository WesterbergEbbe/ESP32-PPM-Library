# ESP32-PPM-Library
A lightweight and fast library for decoding PPM signals from an RC receiver using an esp32.
This library simplifies reading PPM (Pulse Position Modulation) signals, making it easy to retrieve channel data for applications like remote controllers, RC vehicles, and more.
Provides channel pulse widths (in microseconds) for easy mapping to servos or other devices.

I used an FS-iA6B receiver.
